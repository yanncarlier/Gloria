The purpose of this project is to solve the need for trusting as less as possible a 3rd party, for example, an Oracle, when interacting with a blockchain.

Setting a combination of 3 different methods and simultaneous of Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).

1 - A voice password (a secret repeated 3 times on a mic) pattern recognition will deduct always the same output for the same word and the same person only.

2 - Fingerprint

3 - And Face or Eye (iris) recognition

This 3 biometric inputs must be done simultaneously and will only be stored temporarily and locally.

The private key is generated locally

 on the fly and it will be used to validate or sign a transaction, at that precise moment and deleted as immediately as possible.

This ephemeral state guarantees ownership.

To generate the same output the 3 conditions above listed must meet again.
